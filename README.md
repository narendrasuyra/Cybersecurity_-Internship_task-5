# Cybersecurity_-Internship_task-5
✅ Conclusion
In this task, I successfully used Wireshark to capture and analyze network traffic generated by sending an email through a web browser. This approach allowed me to observe protocol behavior during a real-world HTTP-based email transaction.

📡 Protocols Captured:

DNS – Resolved the mail server's domain name.

TCP – Established reliable communication between client and server.

UDP – Detected in auxiliary services such as DNS queries.

🔍 Key Activities Performed:

Installed and configured Wireshark.

Started packet capture on the active network interface.

Sent an email using a web-based mail service (via browser).

Filtered and analyzed captured packets by protocol.

Identified and highlighted DNS, TCP, and UDP traffic.

Exported the capture as a .pcap file and documented findings with screenshots.

📂 Deliverables:

.pcap file of the packet capture

Screenshots showing captured DNS, TCP, and UDP packets

Summary of protocol activity and observations

This exercise deepened my understanding of how common internet protocols interact during routine web-based actions, and demonstrated the effectiveness of Wireshark as a tool for real-time network monitoring and analysis.
